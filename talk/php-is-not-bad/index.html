        <h3>PHP IS NOT BAD or DEAD! Stop defaming PHP!</h3>
        <p>
            I haven't seen anyone saying that PHP is bad or dead once, instead I saw a lot of people saying that PHP is either dead or bad.
      <h4>Why does this happen?</h4>
      Well, the main reason is because someone tryed php when his version was 5.1 or less, and yes, that was bad and insecure. But PHP isn't insecure anymore!
      It's not worse than Python or Node.js, it's even better and I'll give you some reasons to say it's better.<br>
      1. You can start a web server with just one line.<br>
      <redf3>php -S 0.0.0.0:8000 -t .</redf3><br>
      2. Is faster than Python or Node.js when we talk about databases.<br>
      3. Debugging is better on PHP than Python or Node.js<br><br>
      Well, that are 3 reasons to say PHP is good, but now.. What about those that say that php is dead.<br>
      You can say PHP is bad, it's your opinion even though is not true, but you cannot say php is dead because if you say that php is dead you're a piece of shit.<br>
      <h4>Why isn't PHP dead?</h4>
      I've seen a lot of people saying that PHP is dead, but this is totally false!
      PHP is even more popular than Python in web. Dude, wikipedia uses PHP, tebex uses PHP, some microsoft sites use PHP, 80% sites that you visit run php.<br><br>
      I hope you liked this blog, just to be clear, I'm just giving my opinion this isn't meant to hurt someone.
